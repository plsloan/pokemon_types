# Pokemon Types

This was meant to be my introduction into Electron. It was an app built with the intention of running it locally and building an .exe file using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron/electron-packager).

## Running the App

The exe file is included in this repo, or you can run it using the following commands...

1. `npm run start:react`
2. `npm run start:flask`
3. `npm run start:electron`
